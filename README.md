<h2>Announcements of the exercises and their names in the file: </h2>

- **Exercise 1 / OrganizarNumero:**  Create a Java program, named OrganizeNumber, that receives three integer numbers and prints them in descending order.
- **Exercise 2 / NumeroDecrescente:**  Create a Java program, named DecreasingNumber, that receives an integer and prints, in descending order, the value of the number down to 0.
- **Exercise 3 / SomaMultipl:**  Write a Java program, named SumMultip, that prints on the screen the sum of odd numbers and the multiplication of even numbers between 0 and 30.
- **Exercise 4 / TrocaNumero:**  Create a Java program, named SwapNumber, that receives two numbers (NumA and NumB) and performs the physical exchange of the values of these variables, using a third variable (Swap) for this purpose. Present the values of the variables before and after the exchange. Example: if the read data are NumA = 5 and NumB = 9, these values must be swapped from their original variables and must be as follows: NumA = 9 and NumB = 5.
- **Exercise 5 / ComparaNumero:** Create a Java program, named CompareNumber, that receives two numbers and indicates if they are equal or different. Show the greater and the smaller (in this sequence).
- **Exercise 6 / Media:** Create a Java program, named Average, that calculates a student's average for the subject of mathematics. The student should input their name and the four (numeric) grades for the subject.
